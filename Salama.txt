Blood Bank Management system Use cases

3. Blood Receiver:

Description: This use case involves the process of providing blood to individuals or medical facilities in need, commonly known as blood recipients.

Steps:

The user (typically a medical professional or blood bank staff) initiates a request for blood based on a patient's needs.
The system checks the database for available blood units that match the required blood type and other necessary criteria.
Once a suitable match is found, the system generates a list of potential donors who meet the criteria for donation.
The blood bank staff contacts the selected donor(s) to confirm availability and willingness to donate.
After confirmation, the system updates the donor and recipient records accordingly, ensuring accurate tracking of blood transactions.
The blood is then prepared and provided to the medical facility or recipient in need.
