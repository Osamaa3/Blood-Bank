Blood Bank Management system Use cases

1. Register a Donor:

Description: This use case involves the process of registering a new donor into the blood bank system. The purpose is to maintain a comprehensive database of potential blood donors for future donation activities.

Steps:

The user (blood bank staff or administrator) initiates the donor registration process.
The system prompts the user to enter the donor's personal information, including name, contact details, address, age, gender, and any relevant medical history.
Additional information such as blood type and any previous donation records may be recorded.
The system generates a unique donor ID and stores the donor's information securely in the database.


2. Blood Donation:

Description: This use case represents the core activity of the blood bank â€“ the process of collecting blood from registered donors.

Steps:

The user (blood bank staff) identifies available donors from the database who are eligible for donation based on criteria such as health status, recent donation history, and other relevant factors.
The donor is contacted, and an appointment is scheduled for the blood donation.
During the donation session, the donor's vital signs are recorded, and a brief medical examination may be conducted to ensure the donor is fit for donation.
After a successful donation, the system updates the donor's records to reflect the new donation entry, including the date and quantity of blood donated.


3. Blood Receiver:

Description: This use case involves the process of providing blood to individuals or medical facilities in need, commonly known as blood recipients.

Steps:

The user (typically a medical professional or blood bank staff) initiates a request for blood based on a patient's needs.
The system checks the database for available blood units that match the required blood type and other necessary criteria.
Once a suitable match is found, the system generates a list of potential donors who meet the criteria for donation.
The blood bank staff contacts the selected donor(s) to confirm availability and willingness to donate.
After confirmation, the system updates the donor and recipient records accordingly, ensuring accurate tracking of blood transactions.
The blood is then prepared and provided to the medical facility or recipient in need.
